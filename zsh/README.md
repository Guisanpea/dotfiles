# Using zsh

## Dependencies

When using zsh there are dependencies which has to be met. First, [oh-my-zsh][], and then external plugins, [zsh-autosuggestions][] and [zsh-syntax-highlighting][], and theme, [Powerlevel9k][]

Also you need to install a powerline compatible font

When dependencies are installed source them in your own `.zshrc` and then source the config files on zsh folderÂº
