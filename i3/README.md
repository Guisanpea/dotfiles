Rofi is my chosen application menu and you have to install or replace it

To manage brightness I have chosen to use light https://github.com/haikarainen/light

To have colorschemes on terminal with concordancy of my wallpaper I use pywal

I usually get my wallpapers from https://linux.pictures/

# Tweaks
