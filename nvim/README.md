# Neovim settings

## Dependencies
Currently there are several dependencies which has to be met in order to use properly this configuration of nvim

### Plugins
My preffered plugin manager is [vim-plug][] which can be installed easily, just look onto their repository.

After the installation execute :PlugInstall but first do :checkhealth because some plugins depend on the python neovim library for example

## Tricks

Currently I have set up gnome to swap Esc and Caps Lock. This way I dont have to hurt that much my fingers

On gnome tweaks: ___Keyboard & Mouse -> Additional Layout options -> Caps Lock Behavior -> Swap ESC and Caps Lock___
